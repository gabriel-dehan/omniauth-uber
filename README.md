[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-uber.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-uber)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmilewski/omniauth-uber.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmilewski/omniauth-uber)

Uber OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.x and supports the OAuth 2.0 server-side flow.

You may view the Uber API documentation [here](https://developer.uber.com/v1/auth/#oauth-2-0).

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-uber'
```

Then `bundle install`.


## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Uber` is simply Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :uber, ENV['UBER_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['UBER_CLIENT_SECRET']
end
```

## Configuration

Currently, there is only one configuration option that needs to be set:

* `scope`: A *space separated* list of permissions you want to request from the user (e.g: `profile history request`). All scopes documented by *Uber* are working. Default: `profile`

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :uber, ENV['UBER_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['UBER_CLIENT_SECRET'], :scope => 'profile history'
end

```

## Scope Details

* `profile`:	Access the basic profile information on a user's Uber account including their first name, email address, and profile picture.
* `history`:	Pull trip data including the locations, times, and product type of a user's historical pickups and drop-offs.
* `request`: Allow for trip requests 
* ... see *Uber* developer documentation for more scopes
* 
## Auth Hash

Here's an example *Auth Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'uber',
  :uid => 'xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbb',
  :info => {
    :email => 'foo@bar.com',
    :first_name => 'Tom',
    :last_name => 'Milewski',
    :picture => 'https://d1w2poirtb3as9.cloudfront.net/default.jpeg',
    :promo_code => 'xxxxx',
  },
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'ABCDEF...',
    :refresh_token => 'ABCDEF...',
    :expires => true
  },
  :extra => {
    :email => 'foo@bar.com',
    :first_name => 'Tom',
    :last_name => 'Milewski',
    :picture => 'https://d1w2poirtb3as9.cloudfront.net/default.jpeg',
    :promo_code => 'xxxxx',
    :uuid => 'xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbb'
  }
}
```

## Versioning
This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Violations
of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch
version is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be
immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be
introduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and
should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version
Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'omniauth-uber', '~> 1.0'
